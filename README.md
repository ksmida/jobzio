# Jobzio Job Tracker (MERN Stack)

**Current Status**: The application is under active development. Features such as the dashboard and job CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are partially implemented, while other features, like login/register, 
job search, and and statistics, are still to be added.

## Description

Jobzio is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The application will allow users to register, log in, and manage the jobs they have applied for. 
Users will be able to view, add, modify, and remove job entries, as well as track the status of their job applications, such as whether the application is pending or they have been interviewed for. Users
will also be able to visualize statistics of their job applications, such as total number of job applications, total interviews, jobs declined, etc.

## Features

- User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and access their personal dashboard.
- Job Management: Users can add, update, and remove jobs they have applied for. Jobs include information such as:
  - Company
  - Position
  - Location
  - Status (e.g., pending, interview, etc.)
- Job Search: Users can filter job entries based on job status, position, and other criteria.
- Statistics: Users can view statistics like how many jobs they've applied for, how many are pending, and how many they are interviewing for.
